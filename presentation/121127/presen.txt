# This week's achievement

- 2nd ISA
- Pipeline core
- Display
- Keyboard

# 2nd ISA

Remove redundant instruction

- mul
- not used ALU instructions
- not used Branch instructions
- finv, fmov

Introduce floating 0 register

# Pipeline

- Fetch / Decode at same stage
- 4 clk for ALU and misc, 5 for memo, 6 for FPU
- Forwarding
- Stall only when destination register is used by successor

VERY Thanks to White han and IIDX han.

# min-rt result

About 4,188,274,411 instructions
(without branch padding NOPs)

81.52 secs

# Display

Thanks to hole(@h031) san, IS 2010er.

Given:

- extension board with VGA connector
- simple VGA controller VHDL program.

Implemented:

- text display circuit
- integrate with 2nd core

# Keyboard

Implemented from scratch.

Protocol ~ RS232C

Difficult, than expected.

# Yokyou of November

THIS!

This slide is shown by FPGA.
as you know :-)

# What is computer, huh?

Just execute raytracing program?

Who will get happy with raytracer?
